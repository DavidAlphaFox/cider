= Documentation

Good documentation is just as important as good code.footnote:[If not even more important.]
CIDER is a pretty complex project with numerous features and the user manual is one
of the primary ways to discover those. Please, consider improving and extending it.

== Overview

The manual is generated from the AsciiDoc files in the https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/tree/master/doc[doc] folder of CIDER's GitHub repo and is published to https://docs.cider.mx.
https://antora.org[Antora] is used to convert the AsciiDoc source into HTML.
Antora's filesystem layout is described https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.1/component-structure/[here].

== Installing Antora

NOTE: The instructions here assume you already have (the right version of) node.js installed.

Installing the Antora is super simple:

[source]
----
$ npm install
----

Check out https://docs.antora.org/antora/3.1/install/install-antora/[the detailed installation instructions]
if you run into any problems.

== Editing the Docs

If you want to make changes to the manual's page structure you'll have to edit
https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/doc/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc[nav.adoc].

== Building the Docs Site

To make changes to the manual you simply have to change the files under `doc`.

You can build the documentation locally from the https://github.com/clojure-emacs/docs.cider.mx[docs.cider.mx] repo.

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/clojure-emacs/docs.cider.mx
$ cd docs.cider.mx
$ make build
----

To check the generated site you can simply open `build/site/index.html` in your favourite browser.

== Deploying the Docs Site

NOTE: The manual will be regenerated manually periodically by CIDER's Core Team.

We're currently publishing the user manual to GitHub Pages.
The deployment is handled by a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the
documentation every time something is changed in the documentation site's repository.
It can also be triggered manually if needed.

== Updating the Playbook

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to update the manual's version metadata when cutting CIDER releases.
It lives in `doc/antora.yml`.

When cutting new releases you'll have to updated `antora-playbook.yml` to mention
their relevant tags from which the documentation needs to be build. Here's how this
looks for one of the projects:

[source]
----
- url: https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider.git
  branches: master
  tags: ['v1.7.0', 'v1.8.0']
  start_path: docs
----

TIP: You need to add one such block for each new CIDER module you're adding to the docs site.

== Troubleshooting

The most common mistake that people make is to forget to update the version of an Antora docs module
after cutting a release. This will result in an error saying you've got the same version in two branches (e.g. `master`
and `v1.0`). Fixing this is pretty simple - just update the version to `master` in `antora.yml`.
